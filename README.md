[US CSV Mortality Analysis](https://tokazakiuw.shinyapps.io/BF1-CVD_Mortality/ "link to shinyapps.io page")

This analysis seeks to examine heart disease and stroke mortality rates per county in the United States, and to display existing disparities in mortality rates by ethnicity and gender. This analysis uses data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which documents the stroke mortality rate and heart disease mortality rate by county, ethnicity, and gender.  Data was compiled from 10 individual datasets provided by the CDC, 5 for each cause of death, and is displayed in 2 bar graphs, a map plot, a leaflet plot, and a table, each with unique and pertinent insights derived from the data. The data quality isn't perfect. It lacked representation for minorities. Sometimes the data wouldn’t return data for minorities, it would just say “NA.”  Which results in biased results and thus has harmful effects on minority representation. We adapted to this problem by ommitting insignificant data values and averaging data values in surrounding years. Additionally, the data only covered from 2014-2018; for an in depth analysis tailored towards the medical field, it would be beneficial to have more years of data.
